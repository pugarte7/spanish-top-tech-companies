// Vercel Function: the MCP server, public at /mcp (vercel.json rewrites it here).
//
// The only implementation: scripts/mcp-stdio.mjs serves the same `respond` over
// stdio for local agents, and tests/mcp.test.mjs checks both. The site itself
// is static files from _site/ that Vercel serves without calling this code.
//
// Both eras of the protocol: a request carrying
// _meta["io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion"] is answered statelessly under
// 2026-07-28; `initialize` and anything without that key get the handshake-era
// answers that clients up to 2025-11-25 expect.
//
// Three sources besides data.json: the companies table re-keyed for the company
// tools, /api/v1/company-cells.json; the daily job index /api/v1/jobs.json, read
// when a job tool is called; and an application form read live from its
// board's public API (job_questions). Nothing about the person who applies
// reaches this server: the agent keeps that in a document of its own.
